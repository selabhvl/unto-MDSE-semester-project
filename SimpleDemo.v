  Hello, to run this demo you will need to have installed Coq and the library 
  ExtLib

  The goal is to introduce in a minimal workflow modeling language the concept
  of effects to track task dependency. The concept of task dependency we are 
  tackling is also simple:
    we say that a task A is dependent of another task B if we must execute B 
    before we can execute A.

  The language we are considering uses Actors as the executors and its methods
  as actions. The goal is to enforce such dependencies via a type&effect system.

  This demo serves as a base to then build more interesting restrictions in more 
  complex languages.

  The initial language we are working on is one without concurrency, just actors 
  that have methods that call eachother.
  The syntax is as following:
*)

Open Scope string.

Module SimpleSyntax.
  Definition t := unit.

  Definition ident := string.

  Inductive expression : Type := 
    | call : ident -> ident -> expression
    | wait : expression
    | done : expression.

  Inductive method : Type :=
    | def : ident -> t -> expression -> method. 

  Inductive actor : Type := 
    | class : SMAP.t method -> expression -> actor.

  Definition program := SMAP.t actor.

  (* helper function for later *)
  Definition getExpressionById (c m : ident) (p : program) : option expression :=
    (
      theActor <- (SMAP.find c p);;
      theMethod <- (match theActor with 
      | class ms _ => (SMAP.find m ms)
      end) ;;
      (match theMethod with 
      | def _ _ exp => Some exp
      end)
    )%monad.

End SimpleSyntax.
(*
  So we can just write actors that call eachother conceiding execution
  to the fellow actor.

  for example:
  LeadSinger {                  FirstGuitar {
    sing () {                     solo () {
      FirstGuitar.solo()            LeadSinger.sing()
    }                             }
    start := sing()               start := wait.
  }                             }

  The effect should be obvious, just an infinite jump from 
  singing to sick guitar solos.
  LeadSinger.sing -> FirstGuitar -> LeadSinger.sing -> ...

  But that isn't a workflow, there is no end:

  LeadSinger {                  FirstGuitar {
    sing () {                     solo () {
      FirstGuitar.solo()            LeadSinger.outro()
    }                             }
    outro () {                    start := wait.
      done                      }
    }
    start := sing()               
  }

  now it looks more like:

  LeadSinger.sing() -> FirstGuitar.solo -> LeadSinger.outro().

  The type system should check that there is a done somewhere down 
  the line.

  Let's first define the effect system for this toy language
*)
Module SimpleEffects.
  Include SimpleSyntax.

  Inductive effect : Type := 
    | ϵ
    | C (m: ident) (*(c : ident)*)
    | Sync (e1 e2 : effect) 
  .
  Notation "e1 '|->' e2" := (Sync e1 e2) (at level 100). 

  (* has to be bounded if we don't reach a "done" *)
  Fixpoint getEffect (bound : nat) (e: expression) (p: program) : option effect :=
    match bound with 
    | 0 => None 
    | S n => match e with 
      | call a m => (exp <- (getExpressionById a m p) ;; 
                    next <- (getEffect n exp p) ;;
                    Some ((C m) |-> next))%monad
      | wait => Some ϵ
      | done => Some ϵ
      end
    end.
End SimpleEffects.

(* 
  The effects we've just defined allow us to state that nothing happens (ϵ), 
  that an activity is executed (C) and that something happens after somthing 
  else (Sync)

  Let's write the first example in our syntax and extract its effect.
*)

Module FirstExample.
  Include SimpleEffects.

  Definition emptyActor := SMAP.empty method.
  Definition emptyProgram := SMAP.empty actor.


  Definition sing := def "sing" tt (call "FirstGuitar" "solo" ).
  Definition solo := def "solo" tt (call "LeadSinger" "outro" ).
  Definition outro := def "outro" tt (done).
  Definition start := (call "LeadSinger" "sing").

  Definition LeadSinger : actor := 
    class (SMAP.add "outro" outro (SMAP.add "sing" sing emptyActor)) start.
  Definition FirstGuitar : actor := 
    class (SMAP.add "solo" solo emptyActor) (wait).

  Definition exampleProgram :=
    SMAP.add "FirstGuitar" FirstGuitar (SMAP.add "LeadSinger" LeadSinger emptyProgram).

  (* we get the effect of calling the start expression! *)
  Compute getEffect 10 start exampleProgram.
End FirstExample.
(*
And we get:
= Some (C "LeadSinger" "sing" --> (C "FirstGuitar" "solo" --> (C "LeadSinger" "outro" --> ϵ)))
: option effect

*)


(* 
  Before introducing concurrency let's check how can we use modelchecking 
  in this scenario.
  Let's say we want to have a condition "don't play the outro before a
  sick guitar solo" 
  We can tag "outro" with the dependency "solo"
...
    outro () after solo {
      done
    }
...

  From the quick model we just saw we can think, oh let's model check 
  and in such a simple model is quite straight forward. In this case 
  it would give us a thumbsup, no counterexamples, and if we mess up 
  the order it would show a counter example.

  The scope of this research is to bigger workflows with concurrency 
  involved, where the cause of the counterexample might not be so 
  clear. An good treat of using a type and effect system is that we
  can model check backwards for dependencies in method calls and point
  to the call that is not allowed. 
  This is also benefitial in the evolution of the workflow. We keep
  the type inference tree as a fixed and upon a change in a term we 
  rebuild the affected branches. So no breaking changes can be 
  introduced.

  The main difference with performing a batch of modelchecking props
  in the continuos integration pipeline is that errors are signaled to
  the programer on the run, pointing in the direction of the allowed
  solution.
*)

(*
  Before implementing a type&effect system that checks for dependencies, we 
  need to give meaning to our effects. The semantics of effects come from the 
  dependencies that they conform. 

  Due that we are only checking for existence of certain activities, our 
  property language is just "no constraint", or "this task must be executed".
  Later one we can add complexity by saying "this 2 task" or "n tasks", between
  more interesting properties.

  So let's write a relation between effects and the dependencies that they 
  conform:
*)


Module SimplyModel.
  Include SimpleEffects.

  Definition dependency := option ident. (* so far is only the one we want to be
                                           executed earlier *)

  Inductive models : effect -> dependency -> Prop := 
    | FoundIt : forall d,
      models (C d) (Some d)
    | Next : forall d e1 e2,
      models e1 d \/ models e2 d ->
      models (Sync e1 e2) d 
    | NoDep: forall e,
      models (e) None
  .
  Notation "m |= d" := (models m d) (at level 10).
  
  (* 
    The structure is pretty much a list and we could have defined
    "models" as a List.In of the list, but we are keeping the 
    effects to build up to something more expressive. 
    e.g.
    Definition traces := list ident.
  *)
End SimplyModel.


(* 
  Now we can assert if the effect of an expression is good enough to go to a 
  task dependent task.
  So let's write a simple type&effect system to see how this would all come 
  together.
*)

(* no typing context everything is unit *)
(* we only have an effect context *)

(* helper to define the typesystem *)
Definition all_true {A: Type} (m: SMAP.t A) (acceptor: A -> Prop) : Prop :=
  fold (fun _ x => fun y => and x y) (map (acceptor) m) True.

(* usefull tactics *)

(*
  SymplyTyped is a simple scenario for the dependency being complied at the 
  previous task. But we want to catch dependencies that happend even sooner.
  Let's imagine that the guitarist what's to implement a riff after its 
  solo and then call the outro.
  We get a new program like:

End SecondExample.

(*

  will still come after the "solo".
  To let our type&effect system know this we need to go a bit deeper.

(*
  And now let's add concurrency.

  Let's say that during the riff the Singer want's to do a Chorus:

    LeadSinger {                  FirstGuitar {
      sing () {                     solo () {
        FirstGuitar.solo()            LeadSinger.chorus() & FirstGuitar.riff()
      }                             }
      outro () {                    riff () {
        done                          FirstGuitar.outro()
      }                             }
      chorus () {
        wait
      }
      start := sing()               
    }


  So we need to extend our syntax expressions to admit the & for parallel execution,
  and our effect system to model permutations.

  But it's pretty much the same, because riff is called by solo and then solo is always 
  before outro. So let's break the workflow:
  
  LeadSinger {                  FirstGuitar {
    sing () {                     solo () {
      FirstGuitar.solo()            LeadSinger.chorus() 
      & LeadSinger.chorus()
    }                             }
    outro () {                    riff () {
      done                          done
    }                             }
    chorus () {
      FirstGuitar.outro
    }
    start := sing()

  Now the outro being played after the solo depends on the order of execution of the concurrent threads.

(* 
  An usual feature of a workflow model is synchronisity. We would like to start 
  a task, perform other steps, await for the task (sync) and continue the flow.
  To maintain the language declarative and simple we can generalize the feature
  with a sequencing statement and an await command, so instead of writing:
    FirstGuitar.solo() & LeadSinger.chorus()
  we can write :
    FirstGuitar.solo(); do stuff; await; LeadSinger.chorus()

  Where the await command awaits for all the running processes.
